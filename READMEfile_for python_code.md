For task 3 i have made a python code my self 
a symple explanation is that imagin there is a man at the start
he moves forward and when ever there is a choice of path he clones himself [meaning a new list with the data of path until now is stored]
for the cost method i took that he spends 3 seconds in ~ and 5 seconds in ^ and 1 sec in .
thus according to that i gave lag for that path so that every step can go togethger . 
and the first person(s) to reach G has taken the shortest path.
