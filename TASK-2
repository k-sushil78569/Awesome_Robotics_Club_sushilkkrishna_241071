I’m deeply fascinated by robotics and intelligent systems, and each of my chosen projects offers a unique opportunity to explore different aspects of this field.

The Autonomous Navigation project excites me due to its integration of pathfinding algorithms, obstacle avoidance, and real-time decision-making—skills crucial for real-world robotic applications. Designing a system that can independently perceive and navigate through complex environments combines both my interest in coding and mechanical systems.

The Ball Balancing Bot using a Stewart platform is particularly appealing for its focus on control systems, inverse kinematics, and real-time feedback. I find the challenge of stabilizing a dynamic system both intellectually stimulating and technically rewarding, especially with the coordination of six linear actuators.

The Hexapod project draws my attention because of its bio-inspired walking mechanism. Understanding gait algorithms, terrain adaptability, and multi-legged coordination opens doors to exploration in biomechanics and robotics. It also ties well with my background in bioengineering and interest in creating lifelike robotic systems.

These projects not only align with my technical strengths and interdisciplinary interests but also offer an exciting path for innovation, creativity, and in-depth research.
